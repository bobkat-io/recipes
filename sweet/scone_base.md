## Scone dough prep directions
1. Do not preheat oven yet, dough needs to chill
1. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat liner

1. In a mixer bowl, mix together all of the dry ingredients - 480g AP flour, 150g granulated sugar, 2 tsp baking soda, 2 tsp baking powder, 2 tsp salt
1. With the mixer on low, add the 8 tbsp cubed butter until the chunks resemble peas
1. Mix in any dry add-ins for your flavored scones
1. Mix in 2 eggs, 1 cup buttermilk, 2 tsp vanilla (for sweet scones), and any wet add-ins just until barely incorporated
1. Heavily flour your working surface and rolling pin
1. Transfer dough to working surface and roll out to 3/4 inch thick
1. Cut dough into triangles and transfer to lined baking sheets

## Baking directions
1. When you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400 degrees
1. Brush buttermilk onto the scones with a pastry brush
1. Sprinkle on demerara sugar (for sweet scones), flaky sea salt (for savory scones), or none for scones you will glaze later
1. Bake for 18 minutes, checking occasionally and rotating halfway through, until scones have risen and are a golden brown with a crispy outside. For scones from frozen, they will only need an additional minute or two in the oven
1. For glazed scones, allow to cool completely before drizzling with glaze
1. Serve immediately, as scones will lose their crunchiness overnight
