## Instructions

Tangzhong
1. Combine 71g water, 71g whole milk, and 25g bread flour in a small saucepan, and whisk until no lumps remain
1. Place the saucepan over medium heat, and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until thick and the whisk leaves lines on the bottom of the pa
1. Remove from the heat, and set aside

Dough
1. If using active dry yeast, bloom 1 1/4 tbsps in the 170g milk, room temperature 
1. Melt and cool 85g unsalted butter
1. Combine the tangzhong, 495g bread flour, 21g dry milk, 11g table salt, 1 tbsp instant yeast or bloomed 1 1/4 tbsps active dry yeast, 170g milk, 2 large eggs, 85g unsalted butter
1. Mix just until everything comes together
1. Cover the dough and let rest for 20 minutes
1. Knead the dough to make a smooth, elastic dough (it will be slightly sticky)
1. Shape the dough into a ball, and let rest in a lightly greased, covered bowl for 60-90 minutes until puffy (it won't necessarily double in bulk)

Filling
1. Combine 142g brown sugar with 4 tsps cinnamon until the cinnamon is thoroughly distributed

Assembly
1. Lightly flour your work surface and turn out the dough
1. Gently deflate the dough, divide it in half with a bench scraper
1. Working once piece at a time, shape into a rough rectangle and roll dough out to 18" x 8" 
1. Sprinkle half the filling onto the rolled-out dough
1. Starting with a long edge, roll the dough into a log
1. With the seam underneath, cut the log into 12 slices, 1 1/2" each
1. Repeat with the second piece of dough and the remaining filling
1. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan. Space the rolls in the pan

Last rise + bake
1. Cover the pan and let the rolls rise for 45 to 60 minutes, until they're crowding one another and are quite puffy
1. While the rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the bottom third.
1. Uncover the rolls, and bake them for 22 to 25 minutes, until they feel set (just barely browned is okay, don't over-bake). Interior temperature should be about 188°F

Icing
1. While the rolls are baking, stir together 227g confectioners' sugar, a pinch of table salt, 28g melted unsalted butter, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, and 28g to 43g (2 to 3 tablespoons) milk or heavy cream - enough of the milk to make a thick spreadable icing
1. The icing should be quite stiff, about the consistency of softened cream cheese

The finale
1. Remove the rolls from the oven, and (optionally) turn them out of the pan onto a rack
1. Spread the icing over the rolls, it'll partially melt into the rolls
1. Serve the cinnamon rolls warm
