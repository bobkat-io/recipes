> Adapted from [birthday cake blondies](https://github.com/bobkat-io/recipes/blob/master/sweet/birthday_cake_blondies.md)

## Ingredients 
* 1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
* 160 grams light brown sugar
* 160 grams cups granulated sugar
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs, room temperature
* 3 tbsp whole milk or milk alternative, room temperature
* 70 grams Biscoff cookie butter spread
* 355 grams (approx 2.5 cups) all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 1/2 cups white chocolate or butterscotch chips

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Line a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with parchment paper (a 9x9 will work too for thicker blondies, and will require longer to bake through)
1. Combine the 160 grams brown sugar, 160 grams granulated sugar and 1 cup room-temp butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer incredibly thick and fluffy, about 3-5 minutes. Ensure the mixture is whipped enough or the blondies will be under-aerated and sink in the middle
1. Beat in the 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1. Add two eggs, one at a time, beating well after each
1. Add 3 tbsp milk and beat until smooth
1. Add 70 grams Biscoff spread and beat until fully incorporated
1. In a separate bowl, whisk together the 355 grams flour, 1 tsp baking soda, and 1 tsp salt
1. Add half the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and gently mix to incorporate. Add the remaining flour mixture. Take care to not overmix
1. Fold in the 1 1/2 cups white chocolate chips
1. Spread mixture evenly into the pan
1. Bake 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean from the center
1. Cool on a cooling rack before cutting into bars
