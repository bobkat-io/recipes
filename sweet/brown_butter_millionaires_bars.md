> Adapted from [this recipe](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/brown-butter-millionaires-bars/)

## Ingredients 

Shortbread
* 1/2 cup salted butter at room temperature, divided
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 90 grams dark brown sugar
* 150 grams all-purpose flour

Caramel
* 1 - 14 ounce can sweetened condensed milk
* 4 tbsp salted butter
* 2 tbsp real maple syrup
* 1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract

Dipping
* 20 ounces semi-sweet or milk chocolate, chopped
* 1 tbsp coconut oil
* Flaky sea salt

## Equipment
* 8x8 pan
* Piping bag or plastic ziploc bag
* Parchment paper
* Wax paper

## Directions

1. Add 1/4 cup butter to a small saucepan set over medium heat, cooking until the butter begins to brown, about 3-4 minutes.
1. Remove from the heat and transfer to a heatproof bowl, such as a glass measuring cup. Stick in the freezer to chill, 10-15 minutes, but no longer.
1. Preheat the oven to 350Â° F. Line a 8x8 inch baking dish with parchment paper.
1. In a large mixing bowl, beat together the remaining 1/4 cup of butter, the cooled browned butter, 90 grams dark brown sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla until creamy.
1. Add the 150 grams flour and mix until fully combined.
1. Press the dough into the prepared baking dish.
1. Bake 20-22 minutes, until lightly golden and toasted. Remove from the oven and let cool, for at least an hour.
1. When shortbread has been fully cooled, prepare to make the caramel. 
1. In a medium pot, combine the can of sweetened condensed milk, 4 tbsp butter, and 2 tbsp maple syrup.
1. Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking consistently.
1. Cook the mixture until it turns golden brown in color and has thickened, about 15-20 minutes. Make sure to stir often to avoid burning the milk, but small brown bits are fine.
1. Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla.
1. Immediately pour the caramel over the shortbread and spread in an even layer.
1. Transfer to the fridge to chill, at least 1 hour or 30 minutes in the freezer but preferrably overnight.
1. Cut the bars into 36 squares. Return to fridge or freezer for at least 10 minutes, until you are ready to dip.
1. Prepare a tray with wax paper. 
1. Melt the 1 tbsp coconut oil and 20 oz chocolate in the microwave until melted and smooth, stirring occasionally.
1. Using two forks, dip each square into the melted chocolate. When dipping, transfer it back and forth between the two forks to remove excess chocolate and allow to drip. Scrape the forks on the side of the bowl often. Place the dipped bars on the wax paper covered tray.
1. If the chocolate starts to thicken during the dipping process, return to the bowl to the microwave for 30 seconds. 
1. Open a piping bag or ziploc bag over a round jar or other container. Fill with a few spoonfulls of melted chocolate, twist to secure the bag, and cut the tip.
1. Drizzle a zig zag of chocolate diagonally over the dipped bars.
1. Sprinkle bars with flaky sea salt (crush up any large salt flakes beforehand), then return the tray to the fridge.
1. Enjoy, and keep in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
