1. Zest lemons on top of dry ingredients with a microplane, set aside

Assembly + Bake
1. Fill both molds with batter, about half way
1. Fill a paper cone halfway with soft butter, and pipe a line down the center of the raw batter
1. Bake for 40-45 min or until the cakes have risen and the tops are golden brown
1. Slightly open the oven door for a full 2 sec to allow the steam to escape. Close the oven door and
continue baking for another 3-5 min
1. To check for doneness, insert a skewer in the center of the split. If the skewer comes out clean,
the loaf is done. If not, bake the pound cake for another few minutes
