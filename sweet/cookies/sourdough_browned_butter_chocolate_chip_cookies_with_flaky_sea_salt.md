# Sourdough Browned Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies with Flaky Sea Salt

Adapted from [this King Arthur recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-chocolate-chip-cookies-recipe)
This requires refrigerating the cookie dough overnight. Plan accordingly.

## Ingredients
* 200g unfed sourdough discard
* 12 tbsp (169.5g) unsalted butter
* 213g dark brown sugar
* 150g granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tbsp vanilla extract
* 113g all purpose flour
* 135g unbleached bread flour
* 3/4 tsp kosher salt
* 3/4 tsp baking powder
* 3/4 tsp baking soda
* 320g dark (60-70% cacao) chocolate, chopped (afood processor works great), divided (255g vs. 65g)
* 320g milk chocolate, chopped (same re: food processor), divided (255g vs. 65g)
* flaky sea salt, to garnish

## Directions
### Brown the butter
		1. In a small, deep pot over medium-high heat, cook the 12 tbsp butter, whisking frequently to scrape the bottom of the pot, until it’s a light honey color and little brown bits form on the bottom of the pot, 4 to 6 minutes
		1. Remove the pot from the heat and transfer to a small bowl or container
		1. Cover and refrigerate the browned butter until it’s opaque and creamy in consistency, about 1 hour
		1. Once the butter has chilled, remove it from the fridge.  

### Make the dough
		1. In a large mixing bowl or bowl of a stand mixer, combine the 213g dark brown sugar, 150g granulated sugar, and browned butter
		1. Mix until it is evenly combined and the mixture has a wet, sandy appearance, about 3 minutes (or a bit longer if mixing by hand)
		1. Add the 200g unfed sourdough starter, 2 eggs, and 1 tbsp vanilla, mixing to fully incorporate
		1. In a separate bowl, combine the the 113g AP flour, 135g bread flour, 3/4 tsp kosher salt, 3/4 tsp baking powder, and 3/4 tsp baking soda
		1. Add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients in 3 batches, mixing just until the ingredients are incorporated
		1. Switch to a spatula and add 255g of the chopped dark chocolate and 255g of the chopped milk chocolate, and mix to combine. The remaining 65g of each chocolate will be used for topping the cookies the following day
		1. Scoop the dough onto a parchment or silpat lined baking sheet into 3 1/3 tbsp / 1 2/3 oz balls for large cookies, or 1.5 tbsp / 3/4 oz for smaller cookies
		1. The dough balls can be placed close together so that they fit on a single baking sheet for chilling
		1. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 8 hours. 

### Bake
		1. Preheat the oven to 350°F with two racks in the middle third of the oven
		1. Remove the baking sheet with the scooped dough from the fridge
		1. Combine the reserved chopped chocolate in a small bowl 
		1. One at a time, dip each scoop of cookie dough into the chocolate so that several pieces adhere to the top and sides
		1. Arrange the cookies on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them 3" apart, with no more than 6 cookies per tray (large cookies) or 12 (small cookies)
		1. Bake the cookies for 18 to 22 minutes for large cookies or ~12 minutes for smaller cookies, until set and slightly golden around the edges but soft in the middle
		1. Remove from the oven and, while still hot, sprinkle each cookie with a little flaky sea salt, if desired
		1. Allow cookies to cool for 5-10 minutes on the sheet pans before enjoying or transferring to a wire rack to cool completely
