# Andes Mint Chocolate Cookies

> Adapted from [this recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/16212/chocolate-mint-candies-cookies/)

Note: this recipe has been halved. This makes about 24 cookies each with 1.5 tbsp of dough. Adjust accordingly if you want more or less cookies!

## Ingredients 

* 3/8 cup unsalted butter
* 3/4 cup light brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon water
* 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
* 1 egg
* 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 package Andes mints
* 2 drops peppermint extract

## Directions

1. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the sugar, butter and water, stirring occasionally.
1. Remove from heat, stir in the chocolate chips until melted and set aside to cool for at least 10 minutes.
1. While cooling, combine the dry ingredients in a medium bowl: 1 1/4 cups flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/4 teaspoon salt
1. Pour the chocolate mixture into a large bowl, then beat in the egg
1. Slowly combine the dry mixture into the chocolate mixture. 
1. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place silpat or parchment paper on cookie sheets
1. Use a 1.5 tbsp scoop to roll out the dough into balls and place 2 inches apart on the cookie sheet. 
1. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, be careful not to overbake. While cookies are baking, unwrap the Andes mints. You will need 1.5 mints per cookie
1. When cookies come out of the oven, place 3 halfs of Andes mints on top of each cookie. If you scooped out smaller dough portions, you can use 1 mint instead. If you want to speed up the melting process you can briefly place the cookie tray back in the oven to use residual heat to melt the chocolate.
1. Once the Andes mint melts (be patient, it's much easier once very melty), swirl the chocolate with a knife to cover the top of the cookie.
1. Let cookies cool completely before enjoying!
1. Store cookies in an airtight container.
