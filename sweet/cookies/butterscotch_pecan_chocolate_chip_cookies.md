* 220 grams all-purpose flour (about ~1 1/2 cups)
* 3/4 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 10 tbsp unsalted butter, divided at room temperature
* 100 grams granulated sugar (about ~1/2 cup)

* 1 large egg, room temp
* 1 tsp Mexican vanilla extract
* 3/4 cup butterscotch chips
* 1/2 cup 72% bittersweet chocolate chunks
* 1/2 cup chopped pecans


## Directions

1. Do not preheat the oven, browned butter and later the dough will need to chill
1. Remove egg from the fridge, and 10 tbsp butter to bring to room temperature
1. In a small saucepan, brown 5 tbsp of the butter. Immediately pour into a glass measuring cup. If the liquid mixture doesn't equal 75 mL, add cold water or ice to total 75 mL
1. Whisk the 220 grams flour, 3/4 tsp baking soda, and 1/2 tsp salt in a medium bowl
1. In a large bowl, beat the 100 grams granulated sugar, 100 grams dark brown sugar, and cooled browned butter on medium-high speed until well-combined and mixture is light and fluffy
1. Beat in the egg and 1 tsp vanilla
1. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour mixture until just combined
1. If dough is warm, refrigerate the dough for 15 minutes before adding chocolate
1. Stir in the 1/2 cup chopped pecans, 3/4 cup butterscotch chips, and 1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate chunks
1. Refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F
1. Use a cookie scoop to roll the dough into 1 1/2 tbsp balls / 3/5 oz for small cookies, or 1.5 oz for large cookies
1. Arrange dough 2 inches apart on a parchment or silpat-lined baking sheet
1. Flatten cookies evenly using a second silpat and tray
1. Bake until the edges set, 11-15 minutes - larger cookies will take closer to 15 minutes
1. Cool for 8 minutes on the pan then transfer to a rack
