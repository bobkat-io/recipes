Based on https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023646-red-wine-pear-cardamom-cake

## Ingredients
### For red wine pears
- 1¼ cups/296 milliliters dry red wine
- 2 to 3 pears, not too ripe (1 pound), peeled, cored, and sliced ½-inch thick (2 cups sliced pears)
- 2 tablespoons/28 grams unsalted butter
- 1 to 2 tablespoons/12 to 25 grams granulated sugar

### For the cake
- ½ cup/113 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing the pan
- ¾ cup/150 grams granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1 orange
- ¼ teaspoon fine sea or table salt
- 1 cup/125 grams all-purpose flour + 1 tbsp
- 1/2 tsp vanilla paste or extract
- Heavy whipping cream, to serve (optional)

## Directions

### Prep
1. Zest the orange over the 125g + 1 tbsp flour in a medium bowl
1. Squeeze the orange and divide the juice in half

### Prepare the pears
1. Pour the wine and half of the orange juice into a large skillet and place it over medium-high heat. Let simmer until it reduces by half, 5 to 8 minutes.
1. Add the pears, butter and sugar (use less sugar if your pears are very sweet). Let simmer until the pears absorb the wine and caramelize, 7 to 10 minutes. All the liquid should be gone.
1. Spoon pears into a bowl and let cool while you prepare the cake batter.

### Prepare the cake batter
1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. 
1. Butter an 8-or 9-inch springform pan, dust with flour and remove any excess.
1. Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle, or a bowl and wooden spoon, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 2 to 6 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time.
1. In the medium bowl of flour and zest, add the baking powder, cardamom, and salt, and beat until smooth.
1. Beat in flour mixture to wet mixture until combined.
1. Scrape batter into the pan and smooth the top.
1. Lay the pear slices on top of the cake.
1. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour (the 9-inch pan bakes faster than the 8-inch). The top should be light golden, and the crumb should spring back when lightly
pressed with a finger.
1. Serve warm or at room temperature, served with whipped cream, if you'd like
1. Cake will keep in the refrigerator for 24 hours; bring to room temperature before serving.
