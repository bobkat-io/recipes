## Instructions
Prep
1. Brush butter into two small baking loaf pans or one 9x5 loaf pan, line with parchment paper, and brush again
1. Generously dust the pans with flour, then tap out excess flour
1. Preheat the oven to 340 F

Batter
1. Sift together 230g cake flour and 3.5g baking powder
1. Zest 2 lemons on top of dry ingredients with a microplane, set aside
1. Combine 250g whole eggs, 330g granulated sugar, and 3g salt in a stand mixer bowl and whisk on medium speed until frothy (about 1 minute)
1. Alternate the 150g sour cream and dry ingredeints into the egg mixture
1. Add the 150g melted butter and mix to combine (do not overmix)

Assembly + Bake
1. Fill mold(s) with batter, about half way
1. Fill a paper cone halfway with soft butter, and pipe a line down the center of the raw batter
1. Bake for 40-45 min or until the cakes have risen and the tops are golden brown
1. Slightly open the oven door for a full 2 sec to allow the steam to escape. Close the oven door and
continue baking for another 3-5 min
1. To check for doneness, insert a skewer in the center of the split. If the skewer comes out clean,
the loaf is done. If not, bake the pound cake for another few minutes

Glaze
1. Sift the 100g confectioners' sugar, then zest the remaining on top and transfer to a mixing bowl
1. Squeeze the lemons to get lemon juice, and add 25g lemon juice to he bowl and whisk together to combine
1. Remove the cake(s) from the oven and let cool for 5 min
1. Spread the glaze on top using a pastry brush (this will trap in steam and keep moist)
1. Cool 1 hour before storing
