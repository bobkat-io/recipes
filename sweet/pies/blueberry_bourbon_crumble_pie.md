## Pie dough ingredients
* 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon sugar
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold
* ~3 tablespoons ice water

## Pie dough directions
1. Cut the butter into slices
1. In a food processor, combine the flour, salt and sugar; pulse to combine
1. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal
1. Blend in 1 tbsp ice water at a time, pulse until dough is crumbly but holds together when squeezed. Do not overmix
1. Transfer the dough into a piece of plastic wrap, and form dough into a 3/4-inch thick disk. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate until firm, at least an hour
1. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Roll from the center outward to form a 14-inch round
1. Lift and wrap the dough over a floured rolling pin, and carefully unroll into a 9-inch pie dish
1. Gently fit dough onto bottom and sides of dish. Trim the edges of the dough
1. Chill prepared pie dish for at least 30 minutes, and up to 5 days
1. While the crust is chilling, preheat oven to 400°F
1. Line the chilled pie crust with parchment paper or aluminum foil. (Crunch up the parchment paper first so that you can easily shape it into the crust.) Fill with pie weights or dried rice or beans. Make sure the weights are evenly distributed around the pie dish.
1. Bake until the edges of the crust are starting to brown, about 15-16 minutes.
1. Remove pie from the oven and carefully lift the parchment paper/aluminum foil (with the weights) out of the pie. Prick holes all around the bottom crust with a fork. Return the pie crust to the oven.
1. Bake until the bottom crust is just beginning to brown, about 7-8 minutes. The crust can still be warm when you add the filling.

* Preheat the oven to 375 degrees to sit at room temperature for 5 minutes
* Line a baking sheet with foil and place in the oven to preheat as well
* Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12" round, about 1/8" thick
* Carefully transfer round to pie dish using a rolling pin
* Lift up edges and allow dough to slump down into dish, then press dough firmly against sides and bottom of dish
* Trim, leaving about a ½" overhang
* Line the pie crust with parchment paper and add pie weights, rice, or dried beans
* Par-bake the crust for about 20 minutes
* Remove parchment paper and pie weights / beans / rice
