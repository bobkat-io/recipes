Bring ingredients to room temperature

Crust

1. Press the mixture along the bottom and sides of the springform pan
1. Use the base of a measuring cup and press it on to the crumb mixture into the pan to really pack the crumbs tightly down
1. Let the crust chill in the fridge while you prepare the cheesecake batter

Cheesecake
1. Preheat the oven to 350 F
1. Combine the 900g cream cheese with 300g sugar in a stand mixer bowl and mix on medium speed until well combined and fluffy
1. Blend in the 3/4 cup milk, then add the 4 eggs one at a time, mixing briefly after each addition
1. Mix in 240g sour cream, 1 tbsp vanilla, and 1/3 cup Biscoff spread

1. Prepare a water bath to bake the cheesecake

1. Completely cool the cheesecake to room temperature, then refrigerate until cold
2. Garnish with Biscoff cookie butter and more Biscoff cookies, if desired
