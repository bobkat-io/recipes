> Adapted from [The Food Network's May 2018 guide to 50 chocolate chip cookies](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/packages/baking-guide/cookies-and-bars/50-chocolate-chip-cookies).

## Ingredients 

* 220 grams all-purpose flour
* 3/4 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 10 tbsp unsalted butter, divided
* 50 grams granulated sugar (about ~1/4 cup)
* 150 grams dark brown sugar (about ~3/4 cup), OR 150 grams granulated sugar + 1.5 tbsp molasses
* 1 large egg, room temp
* 1 tsp Mexican vanilla extract
* 1 cup 72% bittersweet chocolate chunks
* 2 tbsp bourbon
* Flaky sea salt

Note: you can try this with bread flour instead of all purpose flour! The cookies will be taller and spread out less, but they will still be chewy and not cakey. 

## Directions

1. Do not preheat the oven, browned butter and later dough need to chill
1. Remove egg from the fridge, and 10 tbsp butter. 5 tbsp of butter will sit to warm to room temp
1. In a small saucepan, brown the other 5 tbsp butter. Immediately pour into a glass measuring cup. If the liquid mixture doesn't equal 75 mL, add cold water or ice to total 75 mL
1. Whisk the 220 grams flour, 3/4 tsp baking soda, and 1/2 tsp salt in a medium bowl
1. In a large bowl, beat the 50 grams granulated sugar, 150 grams dark brown sugar, cooled browned butter, and 5 tbsp room-temp butter on medium-high speed until well-combined and mixture is light and fluffy
1. Beat in the egg, 1 tsp vanilla, and 2 tbsp of bourbon.
1. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in the flour mixture until just combined
1. If dough is warm, refrigerate the dough for 15 minutes before adding chocolate
1. Stir in the 1 cup 72% semisweet chocolate chunks
1. Refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F
1. Use a cookie scoop to roll the dough into 1 1/2 tbsp balls
1. Arrange dough 2 inches apart on a parchment or silpat-lined baking sheet
1. Sprinkle balls of dough with flaky sea salt. Smush any large chunks of salt before sprinkling
1. Bake until the edges set, 11-15 minutes
1. Cool for 8 minutes on the pan then transfer to a rack
